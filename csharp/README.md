# Answers for "Questions to discuss afterwards"

### How did it feel to work with such fast, comprehensive tests?

I appreciated it. I would give my college a lot of credit for it.

### Did you make mistakes while refactoring that were caught by the tests?

Yes

### If you used a tool to record your test runs, review it. Could you have taken smaller steps? Made fewer refactoring mistakes?

Maybe

### Did you ever make any refactoring mistakes and then back out your changes? How did it feel to throw away code?

No

### What would you say to your colleague if they had written this code?

#### Tennis game 1
 - He did a mistake hardcoding the strings "player1" and "player2". I would recommend modifying the test to change the name more easily

### What would you say to your boss about the value of this refactoring work? Was there more reason to do it over and above the extra billable hour or so?

####  Tennis game 1
- It's always good to have a second set of eyes on the program through QA and/or code reviews.
- I found a bug with "player1" and "player2" were hardcoded
- I broke down the GetScore method in smaller pieces. I think the code is easier to read now.
